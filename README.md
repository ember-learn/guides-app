# Ember Guides App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/guides-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-learn/guides-app) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/leil0lxhqtuvh7ga/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sivakumar-kailasam/guides-app/branch/master)

This repository contains the Ember App that powers the [Ember.js
Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com).

This app is essentially a static site generator that pulls in
the markdown that makes up the [Guides Source](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source) and
outputs three things:

- JSON that contains that content
- an Ember App that  is designed to consume that JSON
- static html that is powered by [Prember](https://github.com/ef4/prember) and
[FastBoot](https://www.ember-fastboot.com/)

If that all sounds a bit scary don't worry, thanks to
Ember's _Zero Config_ approach you don't need to worry about any of that to contribute ðŸŽ‰
