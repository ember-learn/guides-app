# [deprecated] Ember Guides App 

This repository was the source for the Ember App that used to power the [Ember.js Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/). This work has since been extracted into [Guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) and the [Guidemaker Ember Template](https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template).

The source for the guides is still avaliable in the same place in the [Guides Source](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source) repository.

## Contributing

All further work will be done on [Guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker), the [Guidemaker Ember Template](https://github.com/ember-learn/guidemaker-ember-template) and [Guides Source](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source).
